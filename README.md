Very naive implementation of render engine.

![sample render](https://github.com/Bardo91/tiny_engine/blob/master/doc/sample_render.gif?raw=true)

### Compile it

1. Clone it and prepare the solution 
```
git clone https://github.com/Bardo91/tiny_engine
cd tiny_engine
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
2. Go to the build folder and open the solution
3. Build all

### Test it
1. Set te_test_win as default project
2. Play the project

### TODO

* Plane culling
* Create window in linux
* Enable control keyboard
